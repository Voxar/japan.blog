# The Japan trip
### Renting out the house
We would not be able to do this trip with a economical baggage of a mortgage interest and living expenses so finding a nice couple to take care of our house is a must. Shouldn’t be hard in a capital city but without any previous experience it took a bit longer than necessary. 
What we learned is to not just pick one tenant and wait for them to sign. Instead have viewings for anyone interested, then rank them to your liking and pick the first one that signs the deal. After a month waiting for our one pick from our first attempt we had 5 viewings in one day and was lucky our top pick signed the same night.

### Leave of absense from work
I had no issues ending my assignment and taking a long leave of absence from my wonderful employer. It’s very nice to work for a small firm. They can’t afford to take their staff for granted as the big players which means they will take very good care of their employees.

It was not super easy to find cheap tickets on a still somewhat reputable airline. Comparing the ticket sites and some airlines own booking we found a huge difference in price, hundreds of dollars between airline direct bookings and sites like google flights or momondo.

### Find a first place to live
Traveling for a long time sets some constraints on your living budget.
We are starting in Tokyo to meet some friends, make som connections, attend some meetups and we will stay for about 8 weeks. Hotels are quite off the table and Airbnbs are a tad too expensive. A hostel is probably an awesome way to met people but living close to strangers for several weeks... perhaps we’ll evaluate later.

In some parts of Japan you can find very affordable apartment hotels but our bet bet for Tokyo seems to be finding a short term private rental or guest house.
